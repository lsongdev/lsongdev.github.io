        <h2>Hello ðŸ‘‹</h2>
        <p class="headline">
          Hi, I'm Liu Song, a full-stack developer with a passion for open-source software.
          I have experience in web and mobile development, as well as a background in embedded systems and
          network
          protocols.
          I enjoy writing tech <a href="//lsong.org/posts">blogs</a> and developing <a
            href="//lsong.org/apps.html">applications</a> in my spare time.
          Proficient in Node.js, Golang, and server operations, I'm always eager to learn more and contribute
          to the
          community.
          Check out my GitHub <a href="https://github.com/song940">@song940</a> for some of my projects and
          feel free
          to connect
          with me to discuss ideas.
          When I'm not coding, I enjoy listening to <a href="//lsong.org/music">music</a> and playing <a
            href="//lsong.org/games">games</a>.
